            <strong>Objective</strong>
            <p>To use graph-theoretic principles for selecting a subset of features of a data set having very large number of features. </p>
            <strong>Approach</strong> 
            <p>Map the features of a data set as a graph, either based on similarity between features or based on information contribution of the features. This gives a unique visualization of the feature relevance or redundancy. Then eliminate irrelevant features and use graph â€“theoretic principles of drawing sub-graphs to derive a subset of the potentially redundant features. </p>
            <strong>Current Status</strong> 
            <p>The initial formulation of the graph-theoretic representation of the features has been done based on similarity and information contribution. Those have been named as Feature Association Map (FAM) and Feature Information Map (FIM) respectively.  </p>
            <strong> Next Step</strong>
            <p>Next step is to implement the concept of fuzzy sets in deciding similarity of features instead of assuming a hard value of similarity threshold. Also, use the concept of rough sets to derive a single subset from multiple potentially optimal subsets. Finally, the algorithm will be tested with a very high dimensional data set.</p>
